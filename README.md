# PM Mana Foundry Module prototyping thing

This is an early prototype module I use to learn Foundry module development and Foundry's DataModel. Some of it is good and worth looking at (might use in the "real" module), other stuff is garbage and can be ignored.

If you have any insights or comments you can open an issue and I'll consider it, but don't shit on the code quality, this is not designed to be good.

## General guide:

For now everything of interest is in "scripts/mana.js".
That script is divded into sections, 
 - //Config stuff is kind of just set-up stuff, 
 - //"API" represents somewhat mature utility functions I might move into the real module
 - //MISC STUFF should mostly be ignored
